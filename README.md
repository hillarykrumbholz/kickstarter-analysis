# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns 
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends based on their initial monetary goal, country of origin, which category they fall into, and what time of year their kickstarter went live. 

Providing insight to client Louise, on what would help make her Kickstarter camapign successful.



### Challenge
A look into the data of what months are best to begin a Theater Kickstarter campaign and looking at the outcome based on gaols for plays. Louise has a goal of $12000 for her play and wants to know the liklihood of reaching that goal. 

The purpose of this report was to do a thorough investigation of what factors make a Kickstarter campaign successful. Some of the factors considered included the category of the campaign, country of origin, monetary goal amount, and time of year the campaign went live. First, when looking at all categories in the study, the data shows that 'Theater' is the most popular across all countries, (Figure 1.) Additionally, it is to be noted that theater campaigns have one of the highest success rates. Next, when looking at the country of origin, 3038 out of 4115 of the Kickstarter campaigns were held in the United States, which indicates they are more popular in the US. Third, there appears to be a correlation between goal amount and success - when there is a more conservative goal, it is more likely to reach success. Last, the time of year when a campaign goes live influences its success - there is a large spike when starting a campaign in the months of May or June, (Figure 2.)

For this analysis, Louise is wanting to start a Kickstarter for a play and wants to know how successful it would potentially be. She has a goal amount of $12000 USD and has an interest in choosing a play like those that she saw at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. First, we can see from Figure 3, that theater Kickstarter campaigns, and more specifically plays are quite popular in the US (Figure 4,) which is beneficial for Louise. When deciding the time of year for this campaign, I would suggest a start date between the months of May and June. As you can see from Figure 5, that there is an increase of success during those months. When looking at the $12000 goal amount, data shows for plays at that amount there is only a 50% chance of meeting the goal (Figure 6.) Plays are most successful at 76% when they have a goal of $1000 or less. Then when looking at the five plays she was interested in at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, they had goals ranging between $1000 and $4000; they all reached success, and the average amount donated by a backer was $40.48. With this information I would recommend decreasing the goal amount to the $1000-$5000 range, as there is still a high success rate of 73%.

There are limitations of this dataset, such as not having exact information on how much each backer contributed to a campaign. We are able to see the number of backers and to then find the average amount donated; however, if we knew how much each individual was giving, we’d be able to identify any campaigns that are possible outliers in terms of success. It would also be beneficial to know how each Kickstarter campaign was promoted. There is a strong possibility links to campaigns that were shared online or advertised had a higher chance of reaching success. While in the dataset there is a ‘Spotlight’ column, with either a ‘TRUE’ or ‘FALSE’, it would be helpful to know exactly what the term spotlight meant. In the scenario that ‘Spotlight’ represents the promotion of a specific Kickstarter campaign on the main webpage, we could have run an analysis to see if a correlation was present between that promotion and the success or failure of a campaign. That information could then be used to create a new table and graph to create a visual representation. Additional tables and graphs that could have been included in this report is seeing exactly how successful all categories and subcategories are in comparison to one another. We can see from figure 1 that ‘Theater’ is the most popular category of campaigns; however, that does not mean it was the most successful category overall. We could make a pivot table and chart for all countries, and then again if we are only interested in looking at the United States. For example, even though ‘Music’ does not have as many campaigns, there is high proportion that reached success in comparison to the total number of music campaigns.
